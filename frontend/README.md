# React Frontend

## Run
```
Make sure you have npm installed as well as all of the content in login-page
If the pages folder does not contain the node_modules folder or the package.json files, then you do not have npm installed
npm install

Move into the pages folder on your terminal and run:
npm start
Some information will appear in the terminal and should end that the webpack compiled successfully
Your browser will then open with the login page!

---

Files to create and edit will be located in the src folder within login-page
.js files have actual code to build the site
.css files style the website to make it look pretty
```
